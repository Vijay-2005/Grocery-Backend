 * Order Entity
 * 
 * This class represents the core Order domain object in the system, which stores
 * information about customer orders. It is mapped to the "orders" table in the database
 * using JPA (Java Persistence API) annotations.
 * 
 * Each order contains:
 * - A unique identifier (auto-generated)
 * - Reference to the user who placed the order (Firebase UID)
 * - Product information
 * - Quantity and pricing details
 * - Timestamp information
 * 
 * This entity is used throughout the application for CRUD operations on order data.
